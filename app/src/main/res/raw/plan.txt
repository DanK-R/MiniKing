the main list will serve as the main questions for the game

The other lists will be introduced into the stack of questions, should the player take the appropriate first action to kick them off.

Each of the auxillary lists are themed and serve to introduce possible different vibes each playthrough of the game might take.

The question format is: 

{question, outcome1, outcome2, res1, res2}

with the list format being: 

Situation@Outcome if yes@Outcome if no@result1.1#result1.2@result2.1#result2.2

    @s denote separate Strings
    #s denote separate sub-Strings
