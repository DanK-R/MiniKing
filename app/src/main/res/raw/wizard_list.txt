Your Majesty, I come to you regarding the wizard abroad in our kingdom. If action is not taken to remove him from our land, we risk the safety and security of our citizens. This wizard has been known to dabble in dark magics and has already caused harm to several peasants. We cannot risk his continued presence in our lands and urge you to take swift action to ensure the protection of our people.@placeholder@placeholder@@
