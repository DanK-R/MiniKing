r setNPC 5 My lord, I bring word from the local parish. The Priest there has received word from away that our Kingdom is to be visited by Her Eminence, the Priestess of religion####. She is heralded as the bringer of a new age, one who will unite the peoples or divide them. It would be seen as a sign of acceptance if you would welcome them into the Kingdom by making an appearance at the church. Would you do us the honour of gracing us with your presence?@You make an appearance at the church to welcome this new religious Icon to your realm. The event is attended by thousands of citizens, from rich to poor. In the weeks that follow, the Priestess of religion#### takes up permanent lodgings in the Kingdom and her new brand of faith spreads quickly among the people. A prosperous time of mirth for all follows, save the Generals who remind you that it can be dangerous to let the Church grow this powerful.@Tempers flare among both the nobility and the common man following your decision to snub the church in such a public manner. Your Generals however, commend you on your good sense to not let them grow too powerful that they cannot be controlled@r#O+#G+#M-@O--#M+
p setNPC 8 I come bearing bad news your Highness, a strange sickness has fallen upon the denizens of the realm. For the past few weeks in the capital people have been found writhing on the paths and in the streets. The ill show no signs, nor symptoms, of the illness once woken from their stupor, but the local apothecaries have declared that a cure must be divined none the less. I come before you on their behalf to request a stipend of aid for alms and research to make quick the curing progress. Might they count on your support?@Due to your quick and plentiful support the apothecaries realize the gravity of the illness and are able to cur the plague before it can ravage the kingdom. The apothecary's guild sings your praises in the streets as a wise and noble monarch leading to a great rise in public sentiment. However you are forced to sit through weeks of treasury meetings on how to recuperate the spent gold.@Your kingdom grows pestilent over the weeks that follow your decision, and as the bodies begin to line the streets you are forced to deploy monetary aid none the less. The army is hit particularly hard by the plague as their group living barracks lead to quick and plentiful transmission. The public outcry is fierce when the apothecary's guild pins the blame on underfunding. It will not be an easy road ahead.@G---#O++@pO---G-M---
m setNPC 11 Your Highness, I am but a lowly beggar and I am not sure if it is really of any concern, but in my travels about the kingdom recently I came upon this young boy doing card tricks in the street. I may be nothing but a fool, but there is something otherworldly about his tricks. I've known many a trick or rhyme in my days, but I've never seen anything like him. I brought him here today hoping you might take him in as a court wizard's apprentice. He is older than the usual lot, almost a man already, yet I beseech you my lord to take him in.@Dispite the objections of the Generals and the Church you take the boy in as court wizard apprentice. It is no small price to hire a mage to give him proper tutelage, but not even a month later the boy is already casting small wonders that delight the court and public. For better or worse he will be no small impact on your kingdom in the years to come. The citizens herald the rising of the wizard magician#### in the taverns across the land.@Thinking him naught but a fool with a scoundrel in tow you send them away. The Generals and the Church agree with your decision and congratulate you on your good sense. You don't hear more about it after that, but there is a small group of citizens that flock to him as a mage in the time that follows. Leading to a small dip in public sentiment.@m#G--#O+#M-@M+#G-
1 setNPC 4 My liege, the city's livestock have been running amok in the town square. We tried sending in the Children's Order of the Sword, but to no effect. Please grant us a few soldiers, lest the food-stocks run for the hills.@With little effort the soldiers are able to get the animals sorted. The people are happy, but the Generals are quite displeased to have their men used as such.@Tragedy strikes, before the child soldiers are able to get the animals sorted they got into the grain stores. We've had to implement rations for a few days to make up for it. The people are unhappy, but word comes to you from the Generals that it was the right thing to do.@O+#M-@O-#F-#M+
2 setNPC 10 Bad news your Highness, the local newsies have declared a hanged man was innocent. If this isn't squashed now we may wind up with a full blown rebellion on our hands. We'll need to pay the media heavily to make this go away, can you spare the funds?@It took a small mountain of gold to appease the newsies' guild, but in the end they publish newly found testimonials that back up the execution. For weeks local merchants sell commemorative biscuits and a small festival springs up surrounding the incident.@Without bribe to quell them, the newsies publish a full blown hit-piece bringing in to question whether the nobility know anything of honour at all. Riots in the streets have got the town guards working overtime, but the Treasurer thanks you for your sensible choice.@O+#G--@O---#M-#G+
3 setNPC 4 It has come to our attention that several peasants have been illegally appropriating the lands belonging to a nobleman, claiming they have been tilling it for several years. The nobleman has petitioned us to restore his land and punish the usurpers, while the peasants argue that they have been working on the land for generations and that they should be given the right to own it. We beseech your Majesty the use of our army to evict these swine.@A throng of protesters showed up to protest the overthrowing of settler's rights, but with the army present no one was daring enough to try anything, at least not then and there. As a sign of graciousness, the nobleman in question sent a veritable dowry of gems and small treasures to the castle for your trouble.@The people are pleased to see you upholding the laws of our land justly, and a contract with the new land owners lead to a period of abundance for the food stores.@O--#M+#G+@O+#F++
4 setNPC 6 Your Majesty, as you are aware, there has been a dispute between two neighbouring villages over the ownership of a fertile piece of land, one of which is run by a lord of our court. Both parties claim that the land belongs to them and have produced various documents to support their claims. However, it is now clear that there is no definitive proof of ownership, and the conflict has escalated to the point where violence is imminent. Shall we pay off the other party and make peace?@Using a small amount of the courts funds, the land is handed over to the local lord. He in turn has pledged a large portion of the produce to the Kingdom.@Without peace between the villages the fires of violence were sparked quickly. Unfortunately as an act of rebellion the lands were salted and rendered useless. Leading to a scarcity of grain. For weeks the soldiers were hard at work just to keep the piece, and some did not make it out unscathed.@G-#F++@F--#M-#G+
5 setNPC 2 My liege, I approach you today seeking your wisdom and guidance on a crucial matter that concerns the safety and security of our kingdom. We are currently facing a serious threat from our neighbouring kingdom, whose armies have launched an aggressive campaign to conquer our lands and subjugate our people. In light of this grave situation, I urge you to provide a decisive ruling that will enable us to effectively counter this aggression and protect our sovereignty. Specifically, I believe we should launch a preemptive strike against the enemy forces. Do I have your support, my liege?@It was a costly campaign to run, and the people are never pleased to be called to war, but our army led a successful charge and scattered the forces gathering near the border.@Letting the situation play out a bit longer lead to us realizing that our neighbours were gathering to found a new border town, not a crusade. After short negotiations a deal is struck for first rights to purchase goods. The General who suggested the pre-emptive attack resigned in shame.@G-#O-#M++@G+#F+#M-
6 setNPC 4 Sire, it is imperative that you take immediate action to strengthen and equip our army. We have seen increasing threats from neighbouring kingdoms, and our current military capability is not sufficient to protect our people and defend our land. We demand that you allocate additional resources for training, recruitment, and modernization of our armed forces. Failure to do so may result in dire consequences for the security and stability of our kingdom.@Your Generals thank you for the extra budget allocated to them and swear to use it well.@Despite the ominous warning the only fallout that came of your decision is what could only have been called an unsuccessful call to action against you by the army. Other than some backing from the more weak willed commoners, it passes without issue over time.@M+#G-@M-#O-
7 setNPC 9 Your Highness, I must request your assistance in a matter of great urgency. My village has been plagued by a series of thefts and we have exhausted all of our resources in attempting to find the vermin. We are in dire need of your expertise and resources to help track down the culprits and bring them to justice. Deployment of the town guard would be greatly appreciated in our time of need.@Word comes back to you that 4 of the guards sent to the village were killed in an ambush. The man who stood before you in court that day cannot be located and your advisors have labeled it an attack on the Kingdom. The soldiers are weary to travel to the surrounding villages for some time.@In the days that followed the man asking you for aid several would be assassins are caught trying to ambush a troop of soldiers on the back-roads, none of the assassins survive. Found among them is the man who stood before you. The people rejoice to be protected by such a fierce army as your's and gifts from the nobility are poured onto the Generals.@M--#O-@M++#O+
8 setNPC 1 Your Highness, I come before you today to request your assistance in addressing the possible famine that could engulf our kingdom. The lack of rainfall and poor harvest has led to starvation and suffering among the outer villages. As our wise monarch, we believe that you have the power to bring relief to our plight. We beg for your mercy and graciousness to provide necessary food and resources, to help us survive through these difficult times. Your generosity and kindness will be scribed on the faces of the populace for years to come.@Some of the men who return from the outer villages after making their deliveries claim that the land was cursed, not suffering from any natural drought. With help from the court apothecaries an infestation of insects is noticed and quelled before it could spread too far.@Left unchecked, what the court apothecaries later discovered to be a plague of insects wreaks havoc on the once fertile lands of the kingdom. It takes months to quell the plague and salvage the fields anew.@F+#O+#G-@F---#O-
9 setNPC 7 My Lord, the peasants have discovered a strange artifact on the High Road just north of town. A local self proclaimed Shaman has stated that the artifact is cursed and that to touch it would incur the wrath of the gods. The guards have been refusing to touch the damned thing, but peasants have been showing up in droves to catch a glimpse of the oddity. I think if we don't act quickly we may see a rise in shamanism in the Kingdom. Would you make an official decree to have the thing burned so that order can be restored?@The people see the burning of the artifact to be an unjust flexing of power from the Monarchy. For several weeks replicas of the thing were erected all across the land in protest and the army made a great show of burning those as well.@Left unchecked the phenomenon grows. Before long festivals are had in recognition of a great omen, but both the Treasurers and the Generals are unhappy with the increased spending that these festivals incur. Especially as the soldiers seem to be doing most of the galavanting.@O-#M+@O++#M-#G-
10 setNPC 10 Your majesty, some of the local taxmen have been having trouble with a merchant in the capital and are looking for aid to secure your due funding. So far they've been unable to collect due to threats of great violence. I come to you today to request a small troop of men from the garrison to provide support. Would you grant us this?@The soldiers accompany the taxmen to the business and are able to secure the collection of their dues. However, in the days that follow the Counter's guild, home to the taxing department, is attacked by would be arsonists. In the investigation that follows it is revealed that one of the taxmen had been extorting the merchant, and that their dues had already been paid. It becomes a great scandal in the kingdom, that the kings own men had been extorting the citizen and the taxes become even harder to collect than they already were.@In the weeks that follow your decision it comes to light that the taxmen were not being entirely honest with you. The merchant comes to your court to protest over taxation and is able to support his case with notarized evidence. Thankfully it is mostly a private affair and the resulting culling of the taxing department actually stirs up a bit of auxiliary good news. It turns out this incident was not the only thing that this particular taxman had been doing in the shade, as it is uncovered that he had been embezzling a great deal of military funding due to a few easily closed judiciary loop holes. You recuperate a good deal of stolen wealth and the Generals appreciate the "extra" funding.@G--#O---#@G++#M++
11 setNPC 6 My liege, I bear word from the outer communities that the neighbouring city state of rival#### is claiming that our kingdom is harbouring the would be king killer. The attempt on his life happened last week and now they are claiming that the assassin has fled to our lands. However our inquisitors have turned over solid evidence that they've got the wrong man. What would you have me do? Shall we turn over the man anyway to appease them?@The Generals are displeased that we should cave to such demands so easily, but our neighbours in rival#### are quite pleased with your cooperation and send over a small compensatory gift, surely to try and keep our good relationship going. However the local newsies get wind of the rumour that the assassin may have been innocent and the people rebel at the perceived injustice.@Deciding not to be too hasty, you have the inquisitors try to confirm their suspicions. After a week of heavy pressure from our neighbours the inquisitors finally uncover evidence that the man was indeed out of the country during the time of the assassination attempt, enough to hand him over without a heavy conscious. The Generals congratulate you on your good sense of not caving to their demands too hastily. The newsies have a field day writing the praises of their noble and just monarch, our neighbours in rival#### are not quite so pleased and send over a letter strongly encouraging more swift action in the future.@G+#O--#M-@O++#M++
12 setNPC 3 Sir, would you grant me the honour of extending my permit to grow hemp inside the capital lands? I have submitted a request for extension to the proper departments 4 times now over the course of the last 3 months, but as of yet I have had no response. I am worried that should the date come to close here in 8 days without extension I would have to close up my farms and shutter my business. Please sir, I beseech thee to extend my permit.@You extend the farmer's permit, allowing him another 25 years of work. However the agriculturalist's guild visits you in the days that follow with a troubling message. They claim that the man is only employing indentured servants through a loophole in his previous permit, one that the guild was working to close for the upcoming permit extension. They further claim that the man had made no attempts to file for extension up till coming before you. The cost to repair this situation is quite taxing on the treasury as it included having to pay the buy out rate for the permit. Although the extra land for crops does improve our food stores.@ The citizens make quite a fuss that you would turn down such a simple request of a lowly farmer, decrying the failures of your red tape ridden departments. Furthermore, the farmer does indeed shutter his businesses, and salts his former lands in protest. He is promptly arrested, but the loss of the crops he farmed, along with the loss of farmland itself, leads to a higher burden on the food stores.@F++#G--@O-#F--
